Mipper6 is a multipurpose Discord bot, it's made on JavaScript using discord.js library.
Here's something he can do:

* Moderation commands (kick, clear (purge) and ban)
* Wise quotes (not so wise, but... nevermind)
* Ping command to check if the bot is down

Write ~help to get the full command list. Sorry, but this bot works only on Russian language as of now.

You can invite the bot by clicking below.
